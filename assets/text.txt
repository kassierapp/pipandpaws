We are a closed cattery that is free of genetic disorders. To ensure top quality our breeding cats they have always been health 
tested negative for HCM, SMA and PKD. We test all breeders since Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) is common and we do not want 
other defects to become common. We keep our cats in a clean, family environment. They are given tons of affection and socialization
 with other cats, our three dogs, and our grandchildren of all ages. PipandPaws is located in Comfort, Texas which is near San Antonio,
 Dallas and Houston, Texas. If approved we are usually close enough for new homes to pick up from Oklahoma, New Mexico and Arkansas.

Maine Coons are the largest domestic Cat Breed. The longest domestic cat on record according to the Guinness Book Of World Record. 
The Maine Coon is known for being exceptionally gentle, highly intelligence and there playful personalities. Such combined qualities 
make them ideal pet cat for any owner type.

Maine Coon Kittens leave already altered, micro-chipped, vet checked, dewormed, and vaccinated with age appropriate vaccine shots. 
Maine Coon Kittens will be micro-chipped to ensure safe return should your coon get lost outside. Ethical Maine Coon Breeder only 
allow kittens for sale to go to new homes only after twelve weeks of age or older per CFA & TICA request. By then kittens have had 
their basic inoculations and developed the physical/social stability needed for a new home, showing, or being transported.

About US

Pip and paws was started in 2001 by Pip Quinn due to a passion and love for Maine Coons that started as a little girl growing
 up in the heart of Texas. Today my children and grandchildren get to share every day with these wonderful, intelligent and gentle giants. 
My grandchildren work hard on spoiling all the Maine Coon Kittens that grow up in our home. Many thanks to the wonderful Maine Coon Breeders
 who have worked with me over the years. It is very important to me that I be able to work progressively with other breeders to further the 
breed’s development.

As you can see our cats are raised in the house with tons of love. They live in a clean sanitary environment. 
We try hard to obtain toys that are very mentally enriching so the cats are never bored. Notice in the picture above
the “Catit Design Senses Circuit Cat Toy” this is a great example of a mentally enriching toy great for all cats!

Maine Coon kittens are raised safely & with care in our home!

Thank you, Pip Quinn

Testimonials

HEAR FROM OUR HAPPY FAMILIES.....

Madison & Mason – Red With White/Torbie

"Hi Pip: Jeanne, Katie and I just wanted to tell you how happy we are with Mason and Madison. They are the best cats ever! 
We love to share their pictures with you and keep you up to date. We know you are really their “mom”. From our first contact
 with you through the day we picked them up to bring them home your love and care for them was obvious. They’re both growing 
into healthy Maine Coons. They love to be with us wherever we are. They love our Sheltie “Sparky”. They are Sparky’s best friends! 
Sparky and Maddie roll around on the floor together and chase each other through the house. Always entertaining! They play fetch 
and love water! If water is running anywhere they will be playing in it. While they’re not necessarily “lap babies’ they will follow 
us from room to room and make a point to provide some lap time but will then lay on the couch next to you. They are always in arms reach.
 We check your website often and see that you continue to raise fabulous cats!Best Regards, James”

Holly - Brown Mackerel Maine Coon

Holly has just turned six. We got her from you a little over two years ago. She is so affectionate, happy, & healthy.
 I can hardly believe how much joy she has given me. Oliver (blue & white) & Max will be turning five in the next week. 
It is difficult to get a photo of them separately because they are either in motion, playing, or snuggling.

Keli - Torbie Maine Coon

“Pip,  I cannot begin to tell you how much I love baby Keli.  She is 4 months old and weighs 4.2 pounds and is very healthy.  My husband gave me a sign to 
put up that said, “My cat is not spoiled; I am just well trained.”  It is true.  

 I spend lots of time playing with her and holding her.  She loves to chase balls and the laser light is the most fun of all. She has loads of toys also.  
The first day I introduced her to her bed–well, she loves it and after lots of play she nestles in for a long nap.  The most fun is her cat tree. 

 Climbing it and sleeping on the top platform is a favorite activity.  I know you said cats do not sleep with people—sorry Keli sleeps right beside me.  
The first night my husband suggested that I put her in bed with us because he was afraid she was too lonesome being away from other cats.  Well, she slept 
all night in one spot beside me.  So, now as soon as we get in bed she jumps up and settles down. Bettie”

Opie - Maine Coon

“Hi Pip, I can’t believe that Opie is 16 wks old already ! He is so great! We love him so much and he is having a great time! We had our first 
company this weekend, since he came to live with us . My three little great nieces… He loved playing with them, wasn’t one bit afraid! And as you 
can see~ He loves Ollie, and Ollie loves him!

 He sleeps with us at night and watches Tv with us in the evening ,always hanging out with us! As a matter of fact , he’s on my desk right now messing 
around with everything! You did such a wonderful job raising him, we can’t thank you enough! It is such a wonderful and unselfish thing that you do for
 we humans and your babies! We will always be grateful to you for our sweet boy! I hope that all is well with you and yours! Warmly, Kathy”

Max & Oliver - Maine Coon

“I just wanted you to know that we’ve all had a wonderful week. The kitties are so sweet and pretty funny!  I can’t believe how social, affectionate,
and well-adjusted they are. We’ve never had kitties like this before. They both sleep on the cat tree and enjoy watching the critters 
(a neighbor’s cat, squirrels, doves, etc.) in our backyard when we’re taking a break from playing. Max has started dragging his toys to my 
feet so he can play close. 

Oliver has discovered the computer and wants to be held for a long time, first thing in the morning. We haven’t put them with Toby yet. 
Toby was hissing a lot at first but now seems to be adjusting. I hope to gradually begin introducing them to Toby and the house very soon.
 Thank you for such amazing kittens!! Roxie Elrod”

Tybee & Amadeus - Maine Coons

“Dear Pip: We cannot thank you enough for the honor to adopt our handsome boys. It had been a dream of ours to own a beautiful and loving Maine Coon.
 We are blessed to have found you and now have our two amazing boys: Tybee Anacrusis and Amadeus Legato. Tybee is such a sweet boy.

He is friendly to everyone and loves all the attention he gets. He follows us where ever we go and loves to lay by your side. 
He is definitely a magnificent cat in sight and personality.  He also plays fetch and loves water! He is 1 year old in these photos and he 
gets more handsome every day! Amadeus is extremely friendly and playful.  He loves his brother Tybee.  

He has the most beautiful sage green eyes and his coat is silky soft.  He is very affectionate and will lie on our lap or snuggle with us when we sleep.
 He adores chasing the special spring toy that came home with him.  He is 11 months old in these photos and is growing into a very handsome boy! Both boys 
also enjoy getting brushed and love their paws rubbed.  Their tails are amazing and fluffy! They are the main attraction to all who visit us and we love 
them so very much! – Thank You”

Maine Coons
-MAINE COON THE GENTLE GIANT

Maine Coons were first recorded in cat literature in 1861. Maine Coons were popular competitors at early cat shows in Boston and New York. 
A brown tabby female named ‘Cosie’ won Best Cat at the 1895 Madison Square Garden Show. It is unknown the true origin of the Maine Coon.

One myth is the mating of a domestic cat to a raccoon which is genetically impossible. It is thought the raccoon hybrid myth occurred due to the bushy
 tail of a Maine Coon.

The most accepted theory is that Vikings carried this cat breed over to hunt rats on ships. Aboard Viking ships the cats had to be hardy, strong, 
intelligent and fairly hairy due to the cold environment.

-MAINE COON TEMPERAMENT

Maine Coons are known for being very dog like in temperament. In the feline world of cat fancy the coons are known as a “Gentle Giant” because of 
their impressive size but gentle nature.  Maine Coons hold the Guinness World Record for The Longest Cat in the world. 

The world record was given in 2012 to a five year old silver Maine Coon. Measuring in at a whooping 48.5 inches when stretched out. Adaptable to 
almost an situation is why “adaptable” is the Maine Coon middle name. They are happy with large families or in a single parent home. Loving children 
and other animals of all ages is right up the Maine Coons ally. Any company is good company in a Coon Cats eyes.

Hunting vermin keep prevent spread of disease and destruction of  crops. Interesting fact, only the brown tabbies were called Maine Coon Cats in the
 begin while all other colors were referred to as Maine Shags.

-MAINE COON ENERGY

Maine Coons are a large cat but can happily live in apartments if given proper mental stimulation.

Maine coons are very active cats with intelligence to boot. They are not going to be sleeping all day.

They are not destructive in nature with good manners. Having been a working cat breed for over a hundred 
years these cats like to pull their own weight.

-MAINE COON STANDARD

Maine Coons come in a variety of about 75 different color combinations and two acceptable tabby patterns which are classic and mackerel. 
Maine coons can be with or with out white. If they have white it can be low or high depending on how much is found on the particular cat.

           Low White – Less than 30% of the body has white. 
This includes mittens or lockets.
          High White – More than 30% of the body has white.
 If all white its consider a “white”.

Maine Coons were originally working cats that where bread to endure a harsh climate. Distinctive smooth yet shaggy coat. It should be well 
proportioned and balanced in appearance with no part of the cat being exaggerated.

Quality should never be sacrificed for size. With an essentially amicable disposition, it has adapted to various environments.

-MAINE COON DIET

Maine Coons need a diet that helps deal with the ingestion of hair since they are a longer hair breed. But finding a balanced 
food is always the main priority.

Breeders will suggest having hairball paste, a multivitamin and some other supplement vitamins such as Taurine.

Taurine is a amino acid that is ascertain to heart health helping muscles grow. Maine Coons also need to have food that is not to soft, 
remember that dry cat food is hard to help remove tarter build up on the teeth.

Feeding only wet soft foods can result in poor dental hygiene and even prevent baby teeth from falling out.
